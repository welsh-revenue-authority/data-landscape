## VOA Rating lists

Valuation Officers are required by law to periodically compile and maintain a local rating list for each Billing Authority. In England and Wales there are currently around 350 billing authorities.  There are typically around 2 million properties shown in English and Welsh local rating lists at any one time. 

Every entry in a rating list includes a rateable value. Around 80% of our rateable values are supported by a regular site and building survey. The remaining 20% use more specialised surveys, or are based on construction costs or annual accounts.[^1]
