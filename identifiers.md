## Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN)

UPRNs are the unique identifiers for every addressable location in Great Britain.[^7] UPRNs are hierarchical which means there are parent UPRNs to group child UPRNs, for example, flats within a block of flats.[^8]

The dataset was made available under the Open Government licence in July 2020. [^9] [^10]

## Unique Address Reference Number (UARN)

A Unique Address Reference Number (UARN) is a unique identifier assigned to each Council Tax and Non Domestic Rate record from Valuation Office Agency.

All UARNs are mapped to UPRNs. For a minority of records, GeoPlace are unable to uniquely map UARNs to the lowest level (child) UPRN. In that case a group of UARNs are assigned to a higher level (parent) UPRN. VOA monitors which UPRNs are assigned to UARNs and there is an ongoing effort to reduce the number of UARNs that cannot be assigned to a child UPRN.[^11]
